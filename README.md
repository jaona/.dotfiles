# .dotfiles
**.dotfiles** is a basically a repository to keep track of my configuration files. But this **README.md** file is also a basic checklist I follow to set up a new Mac's development environment. It gets me up to speed with Git, Ruby, GitHub, Jekyll, and more so I can more quickly get back to coding.
